# _E-KYC  Verification_

### Problem Statement (PS) 

- Earlier KYC verification was done in person,but due to COVID-19, this can't be done
- Banks are trying a way to implement a way to perform KYC virtually, since KYC procedures defined by banks are to ensure their customers are real, and to assess, and monitor risks.
- The user needs to upload the necessary  government documents, eg: Aadhar card, PAN card, voter-id, electricity-bill.
- After uploading the documents the person needs to submit a 10 sec video to determine that the person uploading these documents is a legit user.
- The web application incorporates machine learning for recognizing and matching the faces of user with the documents uploaded.
